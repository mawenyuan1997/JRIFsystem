<h1>How to Use Polyglot</h1>

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/polyglot">Polyglot</a>
is an extensible Java compiler front end.
The base polyglot compiler, <tt class="fname">jlc</tt> (&ldquo;Java language compiler&rdquo;), is a
mostly-complete Java front end; that is, it parses and performs semantic
checking on Java source code.  The compiler outputs Java source code.  Thus,
the base compiler implements the identity translation.
</p>

<p>
Language extensions are implemented on top of the base compiler by
extending the concrete and abstract syntax and the type system, and
by defining new code transformations.
The end product is a Java abstract syntax tree (AST)
that is output
into a Java source file, which is compiled with <tt
class="fname">javac</tt>. (For
historical reasons, some extensions just override some portions of
the Java output code to handle the extended syntax of the particular
language extension being compiled rather than rewriting the AST.)
</p>

<p>The compiler <tt class="fname">jl5c</tt> (&ldquo;Java5 language
  compiler&rdquo;) is a Polyglot language extension that provides a
  mostly-complete Java 1.5 front end. Like the base compiler, it
  implements the identity translation.</p>

<h2>
Architecture
</h2>

<p>
The Polyglot compiler is structured as a set of passes over source files
that ends with the output of Java source code.  The passes parse the
original source language and create an AST, rewrite the AST to eliminate
any ambiguities, type check the AST, possibly rewrite the AST to another
AST, then output the AST as Java source code.
</p>

<img style="float: right" src="images/passes.png" alt="Compiler passes">

<p>
When the compiler is invoked (through <code>polyglot.main.Main.main()</code>), it
parses the command line (setting options in <code>polyglot.main.Options</code>), then
creates a compiler object (an instance of <code>polyglot.frontend.Compiler</code>) to
manage the compilation process.  An important job of the command line
parser is to identify the language extension (specified on the command
line with -ext <i>L</i>, where <i>L</i> is the name of the extension), and load the
extension (from <code>polyglot.ext.L.ExtensionInfo</code>). The compiler uses the
extension to determine several important features of the language,
including its source file extension, AST node factory, type system, and
pass schedule.
</p>

<p>
Parsing is done with the Java CUP parser generator and a Polyglot
extension to CUP called PPG.  PPG allows CUP files to be selectively
extended to create parsers for extension languages by providing
operations on a CUP grammar, including adding, dropping, and renaming of
productions.  The JFlex lexer generator is used to create a lexer for
the source language.  The semantic actions in the parser create an AST
through a <code>NodeFactory</code>, which is a class containing factory methods for
creating AST nodes.
</p>

<p>
After the AST has been created by the parser, a series of passes is
performed upon it.  The passes for a language extension, as well as
the order in which they should be run, are defined in the extension's
ExtensionInfo class.  The compiler object runs the passes in the order
specified so that that dependencies between compilation units are
satisfied.  Most passes are implemented using a modified version of the
Visitor design pattern, described later (see also TR 2002-1871).  The
default set of passes is:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>parsing</b>, as described above
<li> <b>build-types</b> (<code>TypeBuilder</code>):  Constructs a <code>Type</code> object representing
      each type in the source file and stores it in a <code>Resolver</code> associated
      with the source file.  <code>Resolver</code>s are used to lookup types by name.
<li>
    <b>clean-super</b> (<code>AmbiguityRemover</code>):  Removes any ambiguities found
      in the declaration of the supertypes of a type (e.g., the <code>extends</code>
      clause).
<li>
    <b>clean-sigs</b> (<code>AmbiguityRemover</code>):  Removes any ambiguities found in
      the signatures of class or interface members.
<li>
    <b>add-members</b> (<code>AddMemberVisitor</code>):  Adds the members of a class or
      interface to its type object.
<li>
    <b>disambiguate</b> (<code>AmbiguityRemover</code>):  Removes any ambiguities found
      in the bodies of methods, constructors, or initializers.
<li>
    <b>type checking</b> (<code>TypeChecker</code>):  Performs semantic analysis for Java.
<li>
    <b>exception checking</b> (<code>ExceptionChecker</code>):  Performs semantic analysis
      upon exception declaration and propagation.
<li>
    <b>reachability checking</b> (<code>ReachChecker</code>):  Checks that all statements
      in each method are reachable from the method entry.
<li>
    <b>exit checking</b> (<code>ExitChecker</code>):  Checks that all paths through methods
      that should return a value do so.
<li>
    <b>initialization checking</b> (<code>InitChecker</code>): Checks that local variables
      are initialized before use.
<li>
    <b>dump</b> (<code>PrettyPrinter</code>):  Optional.  A debugging pass that outputs the AST.
<li>
    <b>serialization</b> (<code>ClassSerializer</code>):  Optional.  Serializes information
      about a compiled class and injects it into the class for output
      during translation.  This enables separate compilation of
      extension languages.
<li>
    <b>translation</b> (<code>Translator</code>):  Transforms each AST node to a String
      and writes it to an output file.
  </ul>

<p>
After many of these passes are &ldquo;barrier&rdquo; passes (implemented by
<code>BarrierPass</code>).  A barrier pass compiles all source files on which a given
source depends up to the same barrier.  This ensures that enough of
the type information of dependent sources has been computed before the
compilation continues.
</p>

<p>
The ambiguities referred to in the above passes are ambiguities
resulting from classification of names in Java.  Some names are
syntactically ambiguous because their meaning cannot be determined
without some semantic analysis (see JLS2 6.5.2).  Extensions may also
introduce new ambiguities that require resolution.
</p>

<p>
Extensions will usually insert passes before type checking to perform
some initial semantic analysis or after it to do some final semantic
analysis, and between exception checking and translation to rewrite the
AST.
</p>



<h2>
Source code hierarchy
</h2>

<p>
All Polyglot code is in the package <code>polyglot</code>.  The subpackages are as
follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> <code>ast</code> <dd>the AST node interface files.  All AST nodes
    implement the <code>polyglot.ast.Node</code> interface.
    </dd>

    <dt><code>types</code> <dd>the type system interface.</dd>

    <dt><code>types/reflect</code> <dd>class file parsing code.</dd>

    <dt><code>visit</code> <dd>visitor classes which iterate over abstract syntax
    trees.</dd>

    <dt><code>frontend</code> <dd>compiler pass scheduling code.</dd>

    <dt><code>main</code> <dd>code for the main method of the compiler in the
    class polyglot.main.Main.  It includes code for parsing command line
    options and for debug output.</dd>

    <dt><code>util</code> <dd>utility code.  This includes the parser generator in
    util/ppg.</dd>

    <dt><code>lex</code> <dd>lexer utility code.</dd>

    <dt><code>parse</code> <dd>parser utility code.</dd>

    <dt><code>ext</code> <dd>code for language extensions.  Source code for
    a language extension lives in the package <code>polyglot.ext.&lt;<i>ext-name</i>&gt;</code>.  The
    default language extension is the "<code>jl</code>" extension which implements Java
    parsing and type checking.  Extensions are usually implemented by
    inheriting from the "<code>jl</code>" extension code.  Extensions usually have the
    following subpackages:
    <blockquote>
    <dl>
    <dt><code>ext.&lt;<i>ext-name</i>&gt;.ast</code>
	<dd>AST nodes specific to the extension</dd>
    <dt>
	<code>ext.&lt;<i>ext-name</i>&gt;.extension</code>
	<dd>New extension and delegate objects specific
                                   to the extension
    <dt>
        <code>ext.&lt;<i>ext-name</i>&gt;.types</code>
	<dd>
	type objects and typing judgments specific to the extension
    <dt>
	<code>ext.&lt;<i>ext-name</i>&gt;.visit</code>
    <dd>visitors specific to the extension
    <dt><code>ext.&lt;<i>ext-name</i>&gt;.parse</code>
    <dd> the parser and lexer for the language extension
    </dl>
    </blockquote>

<p>
    In addition, an extension must define the class
    <code>ext.&lt;<i>ext-name</i>&gt;.ExtensionInfo</code>, which contains the objects which
    define how the language is to be parsed and type checked. There should
    also be a class <code>ext.&lt;<i>ext-name</i>&gt;.Version</code> defined, which specifies the 
    version number of the extension.  The <code>Version</code> class is used as a check
    when extracting extension-specific type information from <tt class="fname">.class</tt> files.
</p>
</dl>
</blockquote>


<h2>
AST nodes, extensions, and delegates
</h2>

<p>
To allow for greater flexibility in overriding the behavior of an AST node,
each node has a pointer to a delegate object and a (possibly null) list of
extension objects.  Extension objects are useful for adding a field or a method
to many different AST nodes.  They provide functionality similar to mixins.
Their purpose is to allow a uniform extension of many AST nodes, not to be the
primary vehicle through which a language extension is implemented.  Delegate
objects are similar to extension objects and are used for overriding existing
methods of many different AST nodes.  For more details, see the tech report
(<a href="http://techreports.library.cornell.edu:8081/Dienst/UI/1.0/Display/cul.cs/TR2002-1883">Cornell CS-TR 2002-1883</a>).
</p>

<p>
In order for the delegates to override the AST node, most calls to the AST node
object should be dispatched through the delegate object.  The default delegate
of every AST node just calls the corresponding method in the AST node.
</p>

<p>
So for instance, to invoke the <code>typeCheck()</code> method on an AST node n, we
do:
</p>

<pre class="code">
      n.del().typeCheck(type_checker);</pre>

<p style="text-indent:0">
instead of directly calling:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	n.typeCheck(type_checker);</pre>
<p>
To reduce the proliferation of classes, all nodes in the base compiler use the
same delegate class. For each compiler pass, the delegate invokes a method in
the AST node that implements the pass. Thus, in the base compiler, passes are
implemented in the AST nodes themselves. Besides reducing the number of
classes, this approach also permits more convenient access to instance
variables of the nodes; delegates access the instance variables of their
associated node through accessor methods. 
</p>

<p>
In writing a language extension, the designer should avoid using this approach
and put the pass implementation in the delegates themselves; this leads to less
work in the number of AST nodes that need to be extended.
</p>

<p>
In deciding whether to put add functionality via inheritance, an extension
object, or a delegate object, use the following guidelines:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
If extending the interface of many different AST node classes, including
adding a member to the common base class of several classes, use an extension.

<li>If overriding an existing method of many different AST node classes,
use a delegate.

<li>Otherwise, use inheritance.
</ol>


<p>
If the designer chooses to use delegates or extensions, delegate
factories and extension factories simplify the task of instantiating
appropriate delegate and extension objects respectively. See below for
more information on node, extension and delegate factories.
  
</p>

<h2>
Writing an extension
</h2>

<p>
Suppose you want to create language <i>L</i> that extends the Java language.
First, you need to design <i>L</i>.  Your design process should include the
following tasks:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
    Define the syntactic differences between <i>L</i> and Java, based on the
    Java grammar found in polyglot/ext/jl/parse/java12.cup.

<li>
    Define any new AST nodes that <i>L</i> requires.  The existing
    Java nodes can be found in polyglot.ast (interfaces) and
    polyglot.ext.jl.ast (implementations).

<li>
    Define the semantic differences between <i>L</i> and Java. The Polyglot base

    compiler (jlc) implements most of the static semantic of Java as defined in
    the Java Language Specification 2.

<li>
    Define a translation from <i>L</i> to Java.  The translation should produce a
    legal Java program that can be compiled by javac.
    </ol>

<p>
Next, you can implement <i>L</i> by creating a Polyglot extension.  Implementing
the extension will require the following tasks.
</p>

<ol>
<li value="5">
    Modify <code>build.xml</code> to add a target for the new extension.  This can
    usually be done by copying and modifying the <code>skel</code> target.

  <p>
    (Optionally) Begin with the skeleton extension found in <tt class="fname">polyglot/ext/skel</tt>.
    Run the customization script found at <tt class="fname">polyglot/ext/newext</tt>, which will copy
    the skeleton to polyglot/ext/<i>L</i>, and substitute your language's name at all
    the appropriate places in the skeleton.
  </p>
    
  <li>
    Implement a new parser using PPG.  To do this, modify
    <tt class="fname">polyglot/ext/<i>L</i>/parse/<i>L</i>.ppg</tt> using the syntactic changes you defined above.

<li>
    Implement any new AST nodes.  Modify the node factory
    <tt class="fname">polyglot/ext/<i>L</i>/ast/<i>L</i>NodeFactory_c.java</tt> to produce these nodes.

<li>
    Implement semantic checking for <i>L</i> based on the rules you defined
    above.

  <ol type="a">
  <li>
	If <i>L</i> involves changing the semantics of Java, you will
	probably want to implement these as part of the type check
	pass already defined by Polyglot.

  <li>
        If <i>L</i> introduces new semantics that are orthogonal to Java,
        you may wish to implement an entirely new pass that runs
        separately from the type checker.

  </li>
  </ol>

<p>
    Semantic changes that are localized to an AST node will probably
    be implemented by overriding that node's <code>typeCheck()</code> method.
    Semantic changes that affect more fundamental properties of the
    Java type system will probably be implemented by overriding
    appropriate methods in <tt class="fname">polyglot/ext/<i>L</i>/types/<i>L</i>TypeSystem_c.java</tt>.
</p>

<li>
    Implement the translation from <i>L</i> to Java based on the translation
    you defined above.  This should be implemented as a visitor pass
    that rewrites the AST into an AST representing a legal Java program.
</ol>

<p>
Let's make this more concrete by introducing an actual extension.  We'll
use the &ldquo;Primitives as Objects&rdquo; (Pao) extension, which
extends Java 1.4 with the ability to use primitive types (e.g., int,
float) as <code>Object</code>s via autoboxing.  For example, in Pao we can write:
</p>
<pre class="code">
    Map m = new HashMap();
    m.put(1, 2);
    int x = (int) m.get(1);</pre>

<p>
The changes to Java needed to support this feature are quite minimal.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
    We modify the grammar to allow instanceof to operate on primitive
    types.  The existing production for instanceof in java12.cup is:

<pre class="code">
	    relational_expression ::=
            ...
        |   relational_expression:a INSTANCEOF reference_type:b
        ;

    In order to allow primitives, we should change this to:

       	relational_expression ::=
            ...
        |   relational_expression:a INSTANCEOF type:b
        ;
</pre>

    <li>
    We modify type checking so that primitive values may be used at
    type <code>Object</code>.  That means for all primitive types <code>P</code> where <code>P != void</code>,
    <code>P &lt;: Object</code> (Polyglot defines <code>void</code> as a primitive type, but <code>void</code> has
    no values).  We'll want to use this relationship in assignments and
    casting, as shown in the example above.  Also, we'll need to allow
    primitive types to appear inside an instanceof operator.

  <li>
    We rewrite the AST to make it a legal Java program.  This means
    that anywhere we see a primitive value being used at <code>Object</code>, we
    should box the value and insert a cast to <code>Object</code>.  We also need to unbox
    primitives when casting from <code>Object</code> to a primitive type.  For completeness,
    we also rewrite the operation <code>==</code> to have it compare
    boxed values by value
    rather than by pointer.  This gives the illusion that all primitives
    with the same value are boxed into the same object.
  </ol>


<p>
We create the extension as follows.  The complete extension is in the
Polyglot distribution at <tt class="fname">polyglot/ext/pao</tt>.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
    We use the <tt class="fname">newext</tt> script to generate a skeleton for the extension.

<pre class="code">
        $ cd $POLYGLOT/polyglot/ext/pao
        $ sh ./newext pao Pao pao
        $ cd $POLYGLOT/polyglot/ext/pao</pre>

<li>
    We modify <tt class="fname">parse/pao.ppg</tt> to redefine the <code>instanceof</code> production to
    allow any type to be used in an <code>instanceof</code> expression.  This required
    only appending the following code to <tt class="fname">pao.ppg</tt>: 

<pre class="code">
      extend relational_expression ::=
	      relational_expression:a INSTANCEOF type:b
	      {: RESULT = parser.nf.Instanceof(parser.util.pos(a),
						a, b); :}
	      ;

      drop { relational_expression ::=
	      relational_expression:a INSTANCEOF reference_type:b; }
</pre>

    The remainder of the file is boilerplate code.
  </li>

<li>
    We next extend the Java type system to handle Pao's semantics.

<pre class="code">
    $ cd $POLYGLOT/polyglot/ext/pao/types
</pre>

    We edit <tt class="fname">PaoTypeSystem_c.java</tt> to override the factory methods for
    primitive types and top-level class types.  We also insert methods to 
    provide access to the runtime boxing classes.

    We next create a subclass of <code>PrimitiveType</code> that overrides the methods:
    <code>descendsFrom()</code>, <code>isImplicitCastValid()</code>, and <code>isCastValid()</code> to
    allow primitives to be used as <code>Object</code>s.
    
    We also create a subclass of <code>ParsedClassType</code> to allow primitives
    to be cast to <code>Object</code>.

<li>
    We create a new extension interface, <code>PaoExt</code>, that extends the <code>Ext
   </code> interface. This extension interface has the signature for a new method,
    <code>rewrite()</code>, which we will use to rewrite the the new <code>Pao</code> code into valid Java
    code.  We also create a class <code>PaoExt_c</code> which extends <code>Ext_c</code> and implements
    <code>PaoExt</code>. The default action for the <code>rewrite()</code> function is to return the node
    unchanged, which is the behavior that is desired for most nodes.

<li>
    We override type checking for the <code>instanceof</code> operation.  To do so, we
    create a new delegate, <code>PaoInstanceofDel_c</code>, that subclasses the JL_c class
    in the base compiler.  In it, we override the <code>typeCheck()</code> to allow
    primitive types to occur in the <code>instanceof</code> expression.  JL_c implements all
    other methods of the JL interface by dispatching back to the node.

    7. We define the translation that will take our Pao language to standard
    Java by defining the implementation of the <code>rewrite()</code> function. 

<p>
    By the translation rules that we have defined, three things will need
    to be rewritten: casts, <code>instanceof</code> operations, and the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operations.
</p>

<p>
    In <code>PaoInstanceofExt_c</code>, we override the <code>rewrite()</code> method to allow for
    instanceof operations on primitive types.
</p>

<p>
    We also create a <code>PaoCastExt_c</code> which extends <code>PaoExt_c</code>, in which we override
    the <code>rewrite()</code> method to box and unbox primitives appropriately to allow
    casting to and from primitive types.
</p>

<p>
    In addition, we create a <code>PaoBinaryExt_c</code> that also exends <code>PaoExt_c</code>, which
    overrides the <code>rewrite()</code> method to rewrite <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> expressions to call
    <code>Primitive.equals(o, p)</code> when comparing two <code>Object</code>s or boxed primitives.
    This method allows boxed primitives to be compared using <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>.
</p>

<li>
<p>
    We add a pass to insert explicit casts to <code>Object</code> when assigning
    a primitive to an object.  We call this pass <code>PaoBoxer</code> and
    implement it as a visitor.
</p>

<p>
    <code>PaoBoxer</code> is a subclass of <code>AscriptionVisitor</code>, which contains code
    to locate places where expressions are used.  The <code>ascribe()</code> method
    is called for each expression and is passed the type the expression
    is <em>used at</em> rather than the type the type checker assigns to it.
    For instance, with the following <code>Pao</code> code:
</p>

<pre class="code">
        Object o = 3;</pre>

    <code>ascribe()</code> will be called with expression <code>3</code> and type <code>Object</code>.

    We override <code>ascribe()</code> to insert casts when assigning a primitive to
    an <code>Object</code>. We override the visitors <code>leaveCall()</code> method to call the
    <code>rewrite()</code> method if the node's delegate is an instance of <code>PaoDel.</code> This
    makes sure that all the appropriate nodes are rewritten to ensure a 
    proper translation.

<li>
    We create a new <code>NodeFactory</code>, <code>PaoNodeFactory_c</code>, that extends
    <code>NodeFactory_c</code>. In this new <code>NodeFactory</code> we override the <code>defaultExt() 
   </code> method to make the default delegate the <code>PaoDel_c</code>, and also override the
    <code>InstanceOf</code>, <code>Cast</code>, and <code>Binary</code> methods to return instantiations of the nodes
    with the <code>PaoInstanceofDel_c</code>, <code>PaoCastDel_c</code>, and <code>PaoBinaryDel_c</code> delegates.

<li>
    We create the <code>ExtensionInfo</code> that defines our extension.
    
  <pre class="code">
        $ cd $POLYGLOT/polyglot/ext/pao</pre>

<p>
    The skeleton generator created most of the necessary code.  We modify
    the <code>passes()</code> method to add our new boxing pass. We also create a <code>Version</code> class that defines the version of <code>Pao</code> that is being worked on.
  </p>
  </ol>


<h2>
Node, Extension and Delegate Factories
</h2>

<p>
Node factories are used to create instances of AST nodes. Extension
and delegate factories simplify the task of instantiating appropriate
delegate and extension objects for the AST nodes.
</p>

<p>
Language extensions will typically implement node factories by
extending the <code>NodeFactory_c</code> class in the package
<code>polyglot.ext.jl.ast</code>. The <code>NodeFactory_c</code> class can be given a delegate
factory and/or an extension factory to use. The classes
<code>AbstractDelFactory_c</code> and <code>AbstractExtFactory_c</code> in the same package
provide convenient base classes for language extensions to extend.
</p>

<p>
For any AST node type <code>&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;</code>, the node factory typically has one or more
methods called <code>&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;</code>, to create instances of <code>&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;</code>. The
implementation of these methods in <code>NodeFactory_c</code> has the following
form:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    public &lt;<i>node</i>&gt; &lt;<i>node</i>&gt;(Position pos, ...) {
        &lt;<i>node</i>&gt; n = new &lt;<i>node</i>&gt;_c(pos, ...);
        n = (&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;) n.ext(extFactory.ext&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;());
        n = (&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;) n.del(delFactory.del&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;());
        return n;
    }</pre>

<p>
Note that first an object that implements the interface <code>&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;</code> is
created: <code>&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;_c</code>. An extension object for the newly created AST node
is obtained by calling the appropriate method on the extension
factory. A delegate object is obtained by a similar call to the
delegate factory. The extension object and/or the delegate object
returned by these calls may be null.
</p>

<p>
The <code>AbstractExtFactory_c</code> class implements the <code>ext&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;</code> methods and
provides convenient hooks for language extensions to override. The
implementation of the <code>ext&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;</code> method in <code>AbstractExtFactory_c</code> has the
following form:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    public final Ext ext&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;() {
        Ext e = ext&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;Impl();
        return postExt&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;(e);
    }
</pre>

<p>
The <code>ext&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;Impl()</code> is responsible for creating an appropriate
<code>Ext</code> object. The default implementation of these methods in
<code>AbstractExtFactory_c</code> is simply to call the <code>ext&lt;<i>super</i>&gt;Impl()</code> method,
where <code>&lt;<i>super</i>&gt;</code> is the superclass of <code>&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;</code>. Thus, for example, the
implementation of <code>extArrayAccessImpl</code> in
<code>AbstractExtFactory_c</code> is:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    protected Ext extArrayAccessImpl() {
        return extExprImpl();
    }
</pre>

<p>
For example, a language extension that needs to provide extension
objects for all expressions and also for class declarations would thus
need to override only two methods of <code>AbstractExtFactory_c</code>:
<code>extExprImpl()</code> and <code>extClassDeclImpl()</code>. Another example: if a language
extension needs to use a single <code>Ext</code> class for all AST nodes, then only
the single method <code>extNodeImpl()</code> needs to be overridden.
</p>

<p>
The <code>postExt&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;(Ext)</code> methods provide hooks for subclasses to
manipulate Ext objects after they have been created. The default
implementation of these methods in <code>AbstractExtFactory_c</code> is simply to
call the postExt&lt;super&gt;(Ext) method, where &lt;super&gt; is the superclass
of <code>&lt;<i>node</i>&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
The structure of the delegate factory AbstractDelFactory_c class is
analogous to that of <code>AbstractExtFactory_c</code>.
