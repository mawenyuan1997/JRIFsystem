	<h1>Major changes to Polyglot for Version 2.6</h1>
        <p>
          See the file CHANGES for more information about the changes
	  made to Polyglot for Version 2.6.
        </p>
      <p>Support for Java 7 language features added, through the JL7 extension (<code>polyglot.ext.jl7</code>),
         which in turn builds on the JL5 extension.
      </p>

      <p>The source code of Polyglot has itself been updated to take advantage of the
	 features introduced in Java 7. This may break older extensions that
	 assume non-generic interfaces.
      </p>

      <p>
	New language dispatcher design pattern. The Delegate pattern used in
	previous versions of Polyglot is still supported, but is now deprecated
	in favor of a new pattern of <em>language dispatchers</em>. Previously
	each node had its own delegate object to perform dispatching to
	pass-specific operations; in the new design, all nodes in a given
	language share the same language dispatcher object. This object is
	responsible for dispatching operations to the appropriate extension
	object for the AST node. The new design pattern adds expressive power,
	eliminates the need for DelegateFactories, and improves performance by
	reducing the number of object creations needed.
