This OCaml library contains several constructions for Kleene algebra
with tests (KAT), that produce symbolic automata out of KAT
expressions, which can then be checked for equivalence using the
symbolic algorithms provided in the SAFA library.

These constructions are described in the following paper,
in Proc. POPL'15 ; 
http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2676726.2677007

Dependencies:
 ocamlfind, safa (all available through opam)

You can compile a standalone program by typing [make].
Then run [./symkat.native -help] to get a list of options.
Typically [./symkat.native '(bc+!b!c)(brs+!brt)' 'bcrs+!b!crt'] will
check whether the two given expressions are equivalent.

Alternatively, you can build an OCaml library by typing [make lib], or
look at the makefile for other targets.

Here is a succinct description of each module:

kat		   : Kleene algebra with tests expressions

antimirov	   : Antimirov' partial derivatives
brzozowski	   : Brzozowski's derivatives
ilieYu		   : Ilie&Yu's construction

hypotheses	   : Hypothesis elimination

parse		   : simple parser for KAT expressions

symkat	 	   : high-level interface of the library,
		     main entry point for standalone program

tests		   : a few sanity tests
bench		   : random benchmarks
